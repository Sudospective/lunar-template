# Mirin Template
[NotITG](https://notitg.heysora.net) is a fork of OpenITG designed to make it easier for mod file creators to implement their ideas. The [Mirin Template](https://www.github.com/XeroOl/notitg-mirin) provides functions that allow creators to use NotITG express their mod ideas and bring them to life in the game.

The Mirin Template is designed to make easing as simple as possible, while remaining incredibly powerful. Eases are the basic building blocks used to make a mod file.

```lua
-- turn on invert
ease {0, 1, outExpo, 100, 'invert'}
-- turn off invert
ease {7, 1, outExpo, 0, 'invert'}
```
